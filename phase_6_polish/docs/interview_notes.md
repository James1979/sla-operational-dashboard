# Interview Notes (90-second pitch)
- I built an SLA dashboard targeting 95% on-time delivery.
- It explains *why* breaches happen (root causes) and how to fix them.
- What-if modeling shows impact of ±10–20% reporter availability.
- Slack alerts notify ops if SLA dips, so we act same-day.
- Result: better SLA, lower backlog, higher CSAT.
