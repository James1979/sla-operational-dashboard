# What-If Modeling Assumptions (I wrote this to explain the logic)

- **Elasticity**: SLA drops ~0.5 percentage points per +5pp utilization above 85%.
- **Regional independence**: Each region planned separately.
- **Simplifications**: Linear effect, constant skill mix & complexity (improve in v2).
- **Usage**: Stress-test hiring/capacity decisions before peak weeks.
